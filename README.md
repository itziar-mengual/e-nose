# e-nose

**Automated data collection with pumps and electrovalves for precise gas analysis.**

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the data collection process of an electronic nose (e-nose) using pumps and electrovalves. The e-nose system is designed to collect and analyze gas samples efficiently, ensuring controlled sampling conditions for accurate data analysis.

## Features
- **Automated Sampling**: Utilizes pumps to control airflow for consistent gas sampling.
- **Electrovalve Management**: Controls electrovalves for precise timing and sequencing during data collection.
- **Data Storage**: Collects gas sensor data for further analysis and visualization.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains scripts for controlling pumps and electrovalves.
- `data/`: Folder for storing collected data samples.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the setup, hardware, and data collection procedures.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)
- Compatible hardware for e-nose setup, including pumps and electrovalves.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itziar-mengual/e-nose.git
